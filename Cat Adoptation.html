<!--------------Getting A Cat Contents----------------->

<section class="Gettingacat">
	<br>
	<p>There is plenty to think about as you prepare to bring your new feline friend home for the first time, and though it may seem daunting at first, we have lots of helpful advice to make this transition as smooth as possible for both you and your new pet.</p>
	<h2>Preparing for the first few days</h2>
	<p>When a cat arrives home for the first time it can be a very stressful period. They have usually come from a place they have known well and are suddenly thrown into a world that smells funny, looks enormous and it can be very daunting. For your cat’s first few days in a new home, it’s best to keep things simple to start with.</p>
	<h2>Cat comforts in the home</h2>
	<p>In general, it’s important to allow your cat the following home comforts in order to make them feel much more content and safe in their own homes:</p>

	<p>Access to a garden - This comes in various forms but it is important that your cat has control over this. Cat flaps are ideal for this situation and can massively help with their behaviour in order to stop them from feeling cooped up when they really want to be out in their own territory. Territory should extend beyond the walls of your home and can even stretch out to include several gardens within the neighbourhood. Let the cat decide if it wants to go outside and how much in order to create a positive environment for everyone (FIV+ Cats will remain indoor only but there is lots you can do to keep them occupied indoors, or provide them with a fully enclosed garden).</p>
	<p>Spaces within their home environment they can retreat to where they can be left alone - These spaces can be hiding spots under tables, in cosy cat beds and also in high up places.</p>
	<p>Opportunity to exercise be that via playing or exploration.</p>
	<p>Somewhere comfortable to rest and relax. Cats will sleep for up to 15 hours a day so don’t deny them the chance to rest their weary heads somewhere they can feel safe. </p>

	<h2>Their first few days in your home</h2>
	<p>It’s important to get your cat set up in one room to start with. When it comes to kittens, this is particularly important as they’ll easily get lost if left to explore the whole house/flat from day one.

	Be sure to provide them with all the resources they need (food, water, litter tray, scratch post, toys,  bedding etc) in the safe room you have established.

	Make sure all the windows and doors are shut and any fireplaces and gaps they can hide in or get lost in are blocked up.

	Keep any other animals away from the new arrival so they have time to settle in first. Any introductions need to be made slowly and safely.

	Make sure children don’t rush in and get too hands on straight away as you don’t want your new feline friend associating children with having had a bad experience when they first arrive home.

	Keep adult cats in one space for a few hours at least so they can acclimatise, and then you can introduce them to the rest of the house in stages, returning them back to their safe room as and when needed. Adult cats tend to sniff about the room and figure out where things go, and will come to you when they feel ready.

	For kittens, you will want to establish them in one space for longer (at least a few days). They need lots of supervision so be aware of what they are up to at all times when they first come home. You can then supervise them around the house as they become more settled.

	Too often, what we ask of our animals when they first arrive home is not realistic. We want things to happen instantly, and this is not always possible. A good mantra to have is to just go at the ‘cat's pace’. This should relieve the stress involved and mean everyone can be happy.</p>

	<h2>Feeding your cat</h2>
	<p>For the first few days, feed your new cat the food they ate whilst at the rescue centre. You will likely be provided with a small portion of food to take home with you, (we supply a small amount of food for our animals going to new homes). If you want to change your cats diet, you should do so gradually by mixing a little of the new food in with the old food and weaning your cat gradually onto the new diet over the course of a week.</p>
